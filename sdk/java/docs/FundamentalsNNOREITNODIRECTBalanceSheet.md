|**accountsReceivable** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Accts_Rec}} is money owed to a business by customers and shown on its Balance Sheet as an asset. {{Accts_Rec}} are created when a customer has received a product but has not yet paid for that product. It is related to {{DaysSalesOutstanding}}, which measures of the average number of days that a company takes to collect revenue after a sale has been made. It is a financial ratio that illustrates how well a company&#39;s accounts receivables are being managed. &lt;br&gt;{{DaysSalesOutstanding}} &#x3D; {{Accts_Rec}} / {{Revenue}} * Days in Period&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**accumulatedDepreciation** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;The {{AccumulatedDepreciation}} of an asset up to a single point in its life. Regardless of the method used to calculate it, the depreciation of an asset during a single period is added to the previous period&#39;s {{AccumulatedDepreciation}} to get the current {{AccumulatedDepreciation}}.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**accumulatedOtherComprehensiveIncome** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{accumulated_other_comprehensive_income}} is the aggregate amount of gains or losses that are not part of retained earnings.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**additionalPaidInCapital** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{AdditionalPaidInCapital}} is the capital that a company raises in a financing round in excess of the capital&#39;s par value. The account represents the excess paid by an investor over the par-value price of a stock issue. {{AdditionalPaidInCapital}} can arise from issuing either preferred or common stock. &lt;br&gt;{{AdditionalPaidInCapital}} is calculated as: {{AdditionalPaidInCapital}} &#x3D; (Issue Price - Par Value) * {{Shares_Outstanding}}&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**bsCurrentDeferredLiabilities** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{BS_CurrentDeferredLiabilities}} represents the current portion of obligations, which is a liability that usually would have been paid but is now pas due.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**buildingsAndImprovements** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{BuildingsAndImprovements}} are capital events that materially extend the useful life of a building or increase the value of a building, or both. A building improvement should be capitalized as betterment and recorded as an addition of value to the existing building if the expenditure for the improvement meets or exceeds the capitalization threshold, or the expenditure increases the life or value of the building by 25 percent of the original life period or cost.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**cashAndCashEquivalents** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{CashAndCashEquivalents}} are the most liquid assets on the balance sheet. Cash equivalents are assets that are readily convertible into cash, such as money market holdings, short-term government bonds or Treasury bills, marketable securities and commercial paper. &lt;br&gt;A high number means either: 1) The company has competitive advantage generating lots of cash 2) Just sold a business or bonds (not necessarily good) &lt;br&gt;A low stockpile of cash usually means poor to mediocre economics.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**cashEquivalentsMarketableSecurities** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Cash_and_Equiv}} are the most liquid assets on the balance sheet. Cash equivalents are assets that are readily convertible into cash, such as money market holdings, short-term government bonds or Treasury bills, marketable securities and commercial paper. Marketable Securities are very liquid securities that can be converted into cash quickly at a reasonable price.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**commonStock** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{CommonStock}} is listed on  the Balance Sheet at the par value of the total shares outstanding of a company. The par value of {{CommonStock}} is meaningless. It is usually set at an absurdly low number.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**constructionInProgress** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;It records the cost of construction work, which is not yet completed (typically, applied to capital budget items). A {{ConstructionInProgress}} item is not depreciated until the asset is placed in service. Normally, upon completion, a construction in progress item is reclassified, and the reclassified asset is capitalized and depreciated.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**currentAccruedExpenses** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{CurrentAccruedExpenses}} is the expense incurred during the accounting period, but not required to be paid until a later date. It includes compensation, interest, pensions and all other miscellaneous accruals reported by the company.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**currentDeferredRevenue** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{CurrentDeferredRevenue}} represents collections of cash or other assets related to revenue producing activity for which revenue has not yet been recognized. Generally, an entity records deferred revenue when it receives consideration from a customer before achieving certain criteria that must be met for revenue to be recognized in conformity with GAAP. It can be either current or non-current item. Also called unearned revenue.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**currentDeferredTaxesLiabilities** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{CurrentDeferredTaxesLiabilities}} means a future tax liability, resulting from temporary differences between book (accounting) value of assets and liabilities and their tax value, or timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in financial statements and their recognition in a tax computation. Deferred tax liabilities generally arise where tax relief is provided in advance of an accounting expense, or income is accrued but not taxed until received.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**debtToEquity** | **BigDecimal** | The Debt/Equity (D/E) Ratio is calculated by dividing a companyâ€™s total liabilities by its shareholder equity. The ratio is used to evaluate a company&#39;s financial leverage. |  [optional] |
|**equityToAsset** | **BigDecimal** | Equity to Asset ratio is calculated as shareholder&#39;s tangible equity divided by its total asset. |  [optional] |
|**finishedGoods** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{FinishedGoods}} are the products in a manufacturer&#39;s inventory that are completed and are waiting to be sold.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**goodWill** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;A {{Goodwill}} is an {{Intangibles}} that arises as a result of the acquisition of one company by another for a premium value. The value of a company&#39;s brand name, solid customer base, good customer relations, good employee relations and any patents or proprietary technology represent {{Goodwill}}. {{Goodwill}} is considered an {{Intangibles}} because it is not a physical asset like buildings or equipment. The {{Goodwill}} account can be found in the assets portion of a company&#39;s balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**grossPpe** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) are the fixed assets of the companyFixed assets are also known as non-current assets. Property, Plant and Equipment includes assets that will - in the normal course of business - neither be used up in the next year nor will become a part of any product sold to customers. Some of the most common parts of Property, Plant and Equipment are: Land, Buildings (and leasehold improvements), Transportation equipment, Manufacturing equipment, Office equipment, Office furniture. Companies with lots of Property, Plant and Equipment often have special categories. For example, railroad property includes: Track, Ties, Ballast, Bridges, Tunnels, Signals, Locomotives, Freight Cars. There is often a note in the financial statements - found in a company&#39;s 10-K - that will explain the different categories of property a company owns. &lt;br&gt;The market value of Property, Plant and Equipment can differ tremendously from the book value of Property, Plant and Equipment. For example, when Berkshire Hathaway liquidated its textile mills, it had to pay the buyers of the company&#39;s manufacturing equipment to haul the equipment  away. That property, plant, and equipment was literally worth less than zero. On the other hand, some companies own thousands of acres of land. All Property, Plant and Equipment other than land is depreciated. Land is never depreciated. However, land is not marked up to market value either. Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), land is shown on the balance sheet at cost. &lt;br&gt;The Property, Plant and Equipment line shown on the balance sheet is {{GrossPPE}}. This means it is the cost of the property, plant, and equipment not less accumulated depreciation.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**intangibles** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Intangibles}} are defined as identifiable non-monetary assets that cannot be seen, touched or physically measured.  Examples of {{Intangibles}} include trade secrets, copyrights, patents, trademarks. If a company acquires assets at the prices above the book value, it may carry {{Goodwill}} on its balance sheet. {{Goodwill}} reflects the difference between the price the company paid and the book value of the assets. If a company (company A) received a patent through their own work, though it has value, it does not show up on its balance sheet as an intangible asset. However, if company A sells this patent to company B, it will show up on company B&#39;s balance sheet as an {{Intangibles}}. The same applies to brand names, trade secrets etc. For instance, Coca-Cola&#39;s brand is extremely valuable, but the brand does not appear on its balance sheet, because the brand was never acquired.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**inventoriesAdjustmentsAllowances** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{InventoriesAdjustmentsAllowances}} represents certain charges made in the current period in inventory resulting from breakage, spoilage, employee theft and shoplifting, etc.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**inventory** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Inventory}} includes the raw materials, work-in-process goods and completely finished goods of a company. It is a portion of a companyâ„¢s current assets.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |

|**landAndImprovements** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;Land is the surface or crust of the earth, which can be used to support structures, and may be used to grow crops, grass, shrubs, and trees. Land is characterized as having an unlimited life (indefinite). {{LandAndImprovements}} is a long-term asset which indicates the cost of the constructed improvements to land, such as driveways, walkways, lighting, and parking lots.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**loansReceivable** | **BigDecimal** |  |  [optional] |
|**longTermCapitalLeaseObligation** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{LongTermCapitalLeaseObligation}} are the amount due for long-term asset lease agreements that are nearly equivalent to asset purchases. Capital lease obligations are installment payments that constitute a payment of principal plus interest for the capital lease. The {{ShortTermCapitalLeaseObligation}} is the portion of a {{LongTermCapitalLeaseObligation}} that is due over the next year.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**longTermDebt** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{LongTermDebt}} is the sum of the carrying values as of the balance sheet date of all long-term debt, which is debt initially having maturities due after one year or beyond the operating cycle, if longer, but excluding the portions thereof scheduled to be repaid within one year or the normal operating cycle, if longer.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**longTermDebtAndCapitalLeaseObligation** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{LongTermDebt}} is the debt due more than 12 months in the future. The debt can be owed to banks or bondholders. Some companies issue bonds to investors and pay interest on the bonds. &lt;br&gt;{{LongTermCapitalLeaseObligation}} represents the total liability for long-term leases lasting over one year. It&#39;s amount equal to the present value (the principal) at the beginning of the lease term less lease payments during the lease term. &lt;br&gt;{{Long-Term_Debt}} can be used to calculate {{ltd2asset}}: {{ltd2asset}} &#x3D; {{Long-Term_Debt}} / {{Total_Assets}}&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**machineryFurnitureEquipment** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{MachineryFurnitureEquipment}} represents those fixed assets specifically dealing with tools, equipment and office furniture.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**markeTableSecurities** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{MarketableSecurities}} are very liquid securities that can be converted into cash quickly at a reasonable price.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |

|**netPpe** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Net_PPE}} (PPE) are the fixed assets of the companyFixed assets are also known as non-current assets. {{Net_PPE}} includes assets that will - in the normal course of business - neither be used up in the next year nor will become a part of any product sold to customers. Some of the most common parts of property, plant, and equipment are: Land, Buildings (and leasehold improvements), Transportation equipment, Manufacturing equipment, Office equipment, Office furniture. Companies with lots of property, plant, and equipment often have special categories. For example, railroad property includes: Track, Ties, Ballast, Bridges, Tunnels, Signals, Locomotives, Freight Cars. There is often a note in the financial statements - found in a company&#39;s 10-K - that will explain the different categories of property a company owns. &lt;br&gt;The market value of {{Net_PPE}} can differ tremendously from the book value of {{Net_PPE}}. For example, when Berkshire Hathaway liquidated its textile mills, it had to pay the buyers of the company&#39;s manufacturing equipment to haul the equipment  away. That {{Net_PPE}} was literally worth less than zero. On the other hand, some companies own thousands of acres of land. All {{Net_PPE}} other than land is depreciated. Land is never depreciated. However, land is not marked up to market value either. Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), land is shown on the balance sheet at cost. &lt;br&gt;The {{Net_PPE}} line shown on the balance sheet is usually net {{Net_PPE}}. This means it is the cost of the {{Net_PPE}} less accumulated depreciation.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**nonCurrentDeferredIncomeTax** | **BigDecimal** | The NonCurrent Deferred Income Tax represents the non-current portion of deferred income taxes, which is the difference in income recognition between tax laws and the accounting methods. |  [optional] |

|**otherCurrentAssets** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;Technically, {{Other_Current_Assets}} line may include any asset that will be used up within the next 12 months. However, {{Other_Current_Assets}} never include assets that are listed elsewhere in the current assets section of the balance sheet. For this reason, {{Other_Current_Assets}} are almost never: Cash, Trade Receivables, {{Inventory}}. The assets grouped under {{Other_Current_Assets}} are most commonly: Prepaid Expenses, Tax Assets, Non-Trade Receivables, Other (too numerous to list). Some companies can and do choose to report each of these items separately. {{Other_Current_Assets}} may be made up largely of Prepaid Expenses - unless these are listed on a separate line of the balance sheet. &lt;br&gt;There are a variety of {{Other_Current_Assets}} like non-trade receivables which are simply too numerous to list. If a company is following correct reporting procedures, it should not lump items that are different from one another and yet individually important to the company together under the line {{Other_Current_Assets}}. &lt;br&gt;At most companies, {{Other_Current_Assets}} are a small and unimportant part of the total balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**otherCurrentLiabilities** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;The liability a company needs to pay in the next 12 months, but not assigned to {{AccountsPayable}} or Debt. For instance, Wal-Mart (WMT) has accrued wages, salaries, valuation, bonuses, insurance liabilities, accrued tax etc. These are all included in {{Other_Current_Liab}}.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**otherCurrentPayables** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{OtherCurrentPayables}} is the payables owed and expected to be paid within one year or one operating cycle that not otherwise classified. It includes dividends payable and all other current payables.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**otherCurrentReceivables** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{OtherCurrentReceivables}} is other current receivables of that not otherwise classified. GuruFocus uses a standardized financial statement format for all companies. GuruFocus lists {{Accts_Rec}}, {{NotesReceivable}}, {{LoansReceivable}} and {{OtherCurrentReceivables}} under the \&quot;{{TotalReceivables}}\&quot; section.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**otherEquity** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{OtherEquity}} is instruments issued by the company that cannot be identified by other specific items in the Equity section. GuruFocus lists following items in \&quot;{{Total_Equity}}\&quot; section: {{CommonStock}}, {{Preferred_Stock}}, {{Retained_Earnings}}, {{accumulated_other_comprehensive_income}}, {{AdditionalPaidInCapital}}, {{Treasury_Stock}}, {{OtherEquity}}.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**otherGrossPpe** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{OtherGrossPPE}} is property, plant and equipment recorded on a company&#39;s balance sheet that not otherwise classified.

|**otherLongTermAssets** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;GuruFocus lists {{InvestmentsAndAdvances}}, {{Intangibles}}, {{Net_PPE}} and {{Other_Long-Term_Assets}} under the \&quot;{{TotalNonCurrentAssets}}\&quot; section. &lt;br&gt;{{Other_Long-Term_Assets}} includes following items: Investment in Properties, Non-current Accounts Receivable, Non-current Note Receivables, Non-current Deferred Assets, Non-current Prepaid Assets, Defined Pension Benefit, Other (too numerous to list). Some companies can do choose to report each of these items separately. Yet, there are a variety of {{Other_Long-Term_Assets}} which are simply too numerous to list.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**otherLongTermLiabilities** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Other_Long-Term_Liab}} are the other liabilities on the balance sheet that do not need to be repaid within the next 12 months, but still need to be repaid over time.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**pensionAndRetirementBenefit** | **BigDecimal** | The total about of pension and retirement benefits |  [optional] |
|**preferredStock** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Preferred_Stock}} is a special equity security that has properties of both equity and debt. It is generally considered a hybrid instrument. {{Preferred_Stock}} is senior to {{CommonStock}}, but is subordinate to bonds in terms of claim or rights to their share of the assets of the company. {{Preferred_Stock}} has priority over {{CommonStock}} in the payment of dividends and any payments received when a company liquidates. &lt;br&gt;{{Preferred_Stock}} comes in many forms. It can be: Convertible or Non-Convertible, Cumulative or Non-Cumulative, Voting or Non-Voting, Callable or Non-Callable, Maturity Date or No Maturity Date. &lt;br&gt;A {{Preferred_Stock}} without a maturity date is called a perpetual preferred stock. These are relatively rare. A good example of perpetual {{Preferred_Stock}} is the many series of Public Storage (PSA) preferred shares that trade on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;br&gt;Before investing in preferred stock, it is important to know which of the above groups the stock belongs to. Is it convertible or non-convertible? Are dividends cumulative or non-cumulative? It is also critical that an investor knows what bonds the company has in front of the {{Preferred_Stock}}. Bondholders get paid first. So the decision to buy a {{Preferred_Stock}} can be similar to the decision to buy a bond. But, remember, the {{Preferred_Stock}} of a company with bonds is junior to those bonds.  &lt;br&gt;Unless a {{Preferred_Stock}} is convertible, the upside in a preferred stock investment is more limited than in a {{CommonStock}} investment. If a company doubles its earnings, it is usually under no more obligation to double the dividends paid to preferred shareholders than it is to double the interest paid to its bankers and bondholders.So {{Preferred_Stock}} is very different from {{CommonStock}}.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**rawMaterials** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{RawMaterials}} are materials and components scheduled for use in making a product.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**retainedEarnings** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Retained_Earnings}} is the accumulated portion of {{Net_Income}} that is not distributed to shareholders. Because the {{Net_Income}} was not distributed to shareholders, shareholders&#39; equity is increased by the same amount. Of course, if a company loses, it is called retained losses, or accumulated losses. Historically profitable companies sometimes have negative {{Retained_Earnings}}. This is because they have cumulatively paid out more to shareholders than they reported in profits. If a company has negative {{Retained_Earnings}}, investors should check the 10-year financial results. They should not assume that negative {{Retained_Earnings}} prove a company has generally lost money in the past. Of course, many companies with negative {{Retained_Earnings}} have indeed lost money in the past.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**shortTermCapitalLeaseObligation** | **BigDecimal** |  |  [optional] |
|**shortTermDebt** | **BigDecimal** |  |  [optional] |
|**shortTermDebtAndCapitalLeaseObligation** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Short-Term_Debt}} is the portion of a company&#39;s debt and capital lease obligation that need to be paid within the next 12 months. It equals {{ShortTermDebt_without_lease}} plus {{ShortTermCapitalLeaseObligation}}. This gives investors an idea of how much money the company needs to pay down for the principle of its debt.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**totalAssets** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Total_Assets}} are all the assets a company owns. From the capital sources of the assets, some of the assets are funded through shareholder&#39;s paid in capital and {{Retained_Earnings}} of the business. Others are funded through borrowed money. &lt;br&gt;Therefore, total assets can be calculated as: {{Total_Assets}} &#x3D; {{Total_Current_Assets}} + {{TotalNonCurrentAssets}} &#x3D; Total Shareholder&#39;s Equity + {{Total_Liabilities}} &lt;br&gt;Total Assets is connected with Return on Assets by {{ROA}} &#x3D; {{Net_Income}} / {{Total_Assets}} &lt;br&gt; Total Assets is linked to {{Revenue}} through {{turnover}}: {{turnover}}  &#x3D; {{Revenue}} / {{Total_Assets}} &lt;br&gt;Therefore, if a company grows its {{Total_Assets}} faster than its {{Revenue}}, the {{turnover}} will decline. This might be a warning sign for the business.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**totalCurrentAssets** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Total_Current_Assets}} are the asset that can be converted to cash or used to pay current liabilities within 12 months. &lt;br&gt;{{Total_Current_Assets}} &#x3D; {{CashAndCashEquivalents}} + {{Accts_Rec}} + {{Inventory}} + {{Other_Current_Assets}} &lt;br&gt;{{Total_Current_Assets}} is linked to the {{current_ratio}}, which is calculated as {{Total_Current_Assets}} &#x3D; {{Total_Current_Assets}} / {{Total_Current_Liabilities}} &lt;br&gt;It is frequently used as an indicator of a company\\&#39;s liquidity, its ability to meet short-term obligations. &lt;br&gt;{{Total_Current_Assets}} is also linked to {{NCAV}}, {{NCAV}} &#x3D; {{Total_Current_Assets}} - {{Total_Current_Liabilities}}.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**totalCurrentLiabilities** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Total_Current_Liabilities}} is the total amount of liabilities that the company needs to pay over the next 12 months. &lt;br&gt;{{Total_Current_Liabilities}} &#x3D; {{AccountsPayable}} + Current Portion of {{LongTermDebt}} + {{Other_Current_Liab}} &lt;br&gt;The increase of {{Total_Current_Liabilities}} of a company is not necessarily a bad thing. This may conserve the company&#39;s cash and contribute positively to cash flow. {{Total_Current_Liabilities}} is linked to {{Total_Current_Assets}} through {{NCAV}} and {{current_ratio}}. The {{current_ratio}} is equal to dividing {{Total_Current_Assets}} by {{Total_Current_Liabilities}}. It is frequently used as an indicator of a company&#39;s liquidity, its ability to meet short-term obligations. &lt;br&gt;{{Total_Current_Liabilities}} is also linked to {{NCAV}}, {{NCAV}} is calculated as {{Total_Current_Assets}} minus {{Total_Current_Liabilities}}.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**totalEquity** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{TotalEquityGrossMinorityInterest}} is residual interest, including minority interest, that remains in the assets of the enterprise after deducting its liabilities. Equity is increased by ownersâ€™ investments and by comprehensive income, and it is reduced by distributions to the owners.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**totalLiabilities** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Total_Liabilities}} &#x3D; {{Total_Current_Liabilities}} + {{TotalNonCurrentLiabilitiesNetMinorityInterest}} &#x3D; {{Total_Current_Liabilities}} + {{Long-Term_Debt}} + {{ther_Long-Term_Liab}} &lt;br&gt;{{Total_Liabilities}} &#x3D; {{Total_Assets}} - {{TotalEquityGrossMinorityInterest}} &lt;br&gt;{{Total_Liabilities}} are the liabilities that the company has to pay others. It is a part of the balance sheet of a company that shareholders do not own, and would be obligated to pay back if the company liquidated.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |

|**totalStockholdersEquity** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Total_Equity}} refers to the net assets owned by shareholders. &lt;br&gt;{{Total_Equity}} &#x3D; {{Preferred_Stock}} + {{CommonStock}} + Capital Surplus + {{Retained_Earnings}} &lt;br&gt;{{Total_Equity}} and {{Total_Liabilities}} are the two components for {{Total_Assets}}: &lt;br&gt;Total Assets &#x3D; Total Shareholder&#39;s Equity + {{Total_Liabilities}}  &#x3D; {{Total_Current_Assets}} + {{TotalNonCurrentAssets}} &lt;br&gt;{{Total_Equity}} is used to calculate {{Book_Value_Per_Share}}: {{Book_Value_Per_Share}} &#x3D; ({{Total_Equity}} - {{Preferred_Stock}})/ {{BS_share}}. &lt;br&gt;The ratio of a company&#39;s debt over equity can be used to measure how leveraged this company is: {{deb2equity}} &#x3D; ({{Long-Term_Debt}} + {{Short-Term_Debt}})/{{Total_Equity}}.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**totalTaxPayable** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{TotalTaxPayable}} is the taxes liability owed to federal, state, and local tax authorities.
