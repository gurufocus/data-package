|**goodWill** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;A {{Goodwill}} is an {{Intangibles}} that arises as a result of the acquisition of one company by another for a premium value. The value of a company&#39;s brand name, solid customer base, good customer relations, good employee relations and any patents or proprietary technology represent {{Goodwill}}. {{Goodwill}} is considered an {{Intangibles}} because it is not a physical asset like buildings or equipment. The {{Goodwill}} account can be found in the assets portion of a company&#39;s balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**intangibles** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Intangibles}} are defined as identifiable non-monetary assets that cannot be seen, touched or physically measured.  Examples of {{Intangibles}} include trade secrets, copyrights, patents, trademarks. If a company acquires assets at the prices above the book value, it may carry {{Goodwill}} on its balance sheet. {{Goodwill}} reflects the difference between the price the company paid and the book value of the assets. If a company (company A) received a patent through their own work, though it has value, it does not show up on its balance sheet as an intangible asset. However, if company A sells this patent to company B, it will show up on company B&#39;s balance sheet as an {{Intangibles}}. The same applies to brand names, trade secrets etc. For instance, Coca-Cola&#39;s brand is extremely valuable, but the brand does not appear on its balance sheet, because the brand was never acquired.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**longTermDebtAndCapitalLeaseObligation** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{LongTermDebt}} is the debt due more than 12 months in the future. The debt can be owed to banks or bondholders. Some companies issue bonds to investors and pay interest on the bonds. &lt;br&gt;{{LongTermCapitalLeaseObligation}} represents the total liability for long-term leases lasting over one year. It&#39;s amount equal to the present value (the principal) at the beginning of the lease term less lease payments during the lease term. &lt;br&gt;{{Long-Term_Debt}} can be used to calculate {{ltd2asset}}: {{ltd2asset}} &#x3D; {{Long-Term_Debt}} / {{Total_Assets}}&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**minorityInterest** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Minority_interest}} is the carrying amount of the equity interests owned by non-controlling shareholders, partners, or other equity holders in one or more of the entities included in the reporting entity&#39;s consolidated financial statements.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**netPpe** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Net_PPE}} (PPE) are the fixed assets of the companyFixed assets are also known as non-current assets. {{Net_PPE}} includes assets that will - in the normal course of business - neither be used up in the next year nor will become a part of any product sold to customers. Some of the most common parts of property, plant, and equipment are: Land, Buildings (and leasehold improvements), Transportation equipment, Manufacturing equipment, Office equipment, Office furniture. Companies with lots of property, plant, and equipment often have special categories. For example, railroad property includes: Track, Ties, Ballast, Bridges, Tunnels, Signals, Locomotives, Freight Cars. There is often a note in the financial statements - found in a company&#39;s 10-K - that will explain the different categories of property a company owns. &lt;br&gt;The market value of {{Net_PPE}} can differ tremendously from the book value of {{Net_PPE}}. For example, when Berkshire Hathaway liquidated its textile mills, it had to pay the buyers of the company&#39;s manufacturing equipment to haul the equipment  away. That {{Net_PPE}} was literally worth less than zero. On the other hand, some companies own thousands of acres of land. All {{Net_PPE}} other than land is depreciated. Land is never depreciated. However, land is not marked up to market value either. Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), land is shown on the balance sheet at cost. &lt;br&gt;The {{Net_PPE}} line shown on the balance sheet is usually net {{Net_PPE}}. This means it is the cost of the {{Net_PPE}} less accumulated depreciation.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**nonCurrentDeferredIncomeTax** | **BigDecimal** | The NonCurrent Deferred Income Tax represents the non-current portion of deferred income taxes, which is the difference in income recognition between tax laws and the accounting methods. |  [optional] |
|**nonCurrentDeferredLiabilities** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{NonCurrentDeferredLiabilities}} represents the non-current portion of obligations, which is a liability that usually would have been paid but is now pas due.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**notesReceivable** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{NotesReceivable}} is an unconditional promise to receive a definite sum of money at a future date(s) within one year of the balance sheet date or the normal operating cycle, whichever is longer.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**otherCurrentReceivables** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{OtherCurrentReceivables}} is other current receivables of that not otherwise classified. GuruFocus uses a standardized financial statement format for all companies. GuruFocus lists {{Accts_Rec}}, {{NotesReceivable}}, {{LoansReceivable}} and {{OtherCurrentReceivables}} under the \&quot;{{TotalReceivables}}\&quot; section.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**otherEquity** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{OtherEquity}} is instruments issued by the company that cannot be identified by other specific items in the Equity section. GuruFocus lists following items in \&quot;{{Total_Equity}}\&quot; section: {{CommonStock}}, {{Preferred_Stock}}, {{Retained_Earnings}}, {{accumulated_other_comprehensive_income}}, {{AdditionalPaidInCapital}}, {{Treasury_Stock}}, {{OtherEquity}}.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**preferredStock** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Preferred_Stock}} is a special equity security that has properties of both equity and debt. It is generally considered a hybrid instrument. {{Preferred_Stock}} is senior to {{CommonStock}}, but is subordinate to bonds in terms of claim or rights to their share of the assets of the company. {{Preferred_Stock}} has priority over {{CommonStock}} in the payment of dividends and any payments received when a company liquidates. &lt;br&gt;{{Preferred_Stock}} comes in many forms. It can be: Convertible or Non-Convertible, Cumulative or Non-Cumulative, Voting or Non-Voting, Callable or Non-Callable, Maturity Date or No Maturity Date. &lt;br&gt;A {{Preferred_Stock}} without a maturity date is called a perpetual preferred stock. These are relatively rare. A good example of perpetual {{Preferred_Stock}} is the many series of Public Storage (PSA) preferred shares that trade on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;br&gt;Before investing in preferred stock, it is important to know which of the above groups the stock belongs to. Is it convertible or non-convertible? Are dividends cumulative or non-cumulative? It is also critical that an investor knows what bonds the company has in front of the {{Preferred_Stock}}. Bondholders get paid first. So the decision to buy a {{Preferred_Stock}} can be similar to the decision to buy a bond. But, remember, the {{Preferred_Stock}} of a company with bonds is junior to those bonds.  &lt;br&gt;Unless a {{Preferred_Stock}} is convertible, the upside in a preferred stock investment is more limited than in a {{CommonStock}} investment. If a company doubles its earnings, it is usually under no more obligation to double the dividends paid to preferred shareholders than it is to double the interest paid to its bankers and bondholders.So {{Preferred_Stock}} is very different from {{CommonStock}}.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**retainedEarnings** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Retained_Earnings}} is the accumulated portion of {{Net_Income}} that is not distributed to shareholders. Because the {{Net_Income}} was not distributed to shareholders, shareholders&#39; equity is increased by the same amount. Of course, if a company loses, it is called retained losses, or accumulated losses. Historically profitable companies sometimes have negative {{Retained_Earnings}}. This is because they have cumulatively paid out more to shareholders than they reported in profits. If a company has negative {{Retained_Earnings}}, investors should check the 10-year financial results. They should not assume that negative {{Retained_Earnings}} prove a company has generally lost money in the past. Of course, many companies with negative {{Retained_Earnings}} have indeed lost money in the past.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**shortTermDebtAndCapitalLeaseObligation** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Short-Term_Debt}} is the portion of a company&#39;s debt and capital lease obligation that need to be paid within the next 12 months. It equals {{ShortTermDebt_without_lease}} plus {{ShortTermCapitalLeaseObligation}}. This gives investors an idea of how much money the company needs to pay down for the principle of its debt.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**totalAssets** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Total_Assets}} are all the assets a company owns. From the capital sources of the assets, some of the assets are funded through shareholder&#39;s paid in capital and {{Retained_Earnings}} of the business. Others are funded through borrowed money. &lt;br&gt;Therefore, total assets can be calculated as: {{Total_Assets}} &#x3D; {{Total_Current_Assets}} + {{TotalNonCurrentAssets}} &#x3D; Total Shareholder&#39;s Equity + {{Total_Liabilities}} &lt;br&gt;Total Assets is connected with Return on Assets by {{ROA}} &#x3D; {{Net_Income}} / {{Total_Assets}} &lt;br&gt; Total Assets is linked to {{Revenue}} through {{turnover}}: {{turnover}}  &#x3D; {{Revenue}} / {{Total_Assets}} &lt;br&gt;Therefore, if a company grows its {{Total_Assets}} faster than its {{Revenue}}, the {{turnover}} will decline. This might be a warning sign for the business.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**totalEquity** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{TotalEquityGrossMinorityInterest}} is residual interest, including minority interest, that remains in the assets of the enterprise after deducting its liabilities. Equity is increased by owners’ investments and by comprehensive income, and it is reduced by distributions to the owners.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**totalLiabilities** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Total_Liabilities}} &#x3D; {{Total_Current_Liabilities}} + {{TotalNonCurrentLiabilitiesNetMinorityInterest}} &#x3D; {{Total_Current_Liabilities}} + {{Long-Term_Debt}} + {{ther_Long-Term_Liab}} &lt;br&gt;{{Total_Liabilities}} &#x3D; {{Total_Assets}} - {{TotalEquityGrossMinorityInterest}} &lt;br&gt;{{Total_Liabilities}} are the liabilities that the company has to pay others. It is a part of the balance sheet of a company that shareholders do not own, and would be obligated to pay back if the company liquidated.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**totalReceivables** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{TotalReceivables}} is the sum of all receivables owed by customers and affiliates within one year, including {{Accts_Rec}}, {{NotesReceivable}}, {{LoansReceivable}},{{OtherCurrentReceivables}}.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**totalStockholdersEquity** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Total_Equity}} refers to the net assets owned by shareholders. &lt;br&gt;{{Total_Equity}} &#x3D; {{Preferred_Stock}} + {{CommonStock}} + Capital Surplus + {{Retained_Earnings}} &lt;br&gt;{{Total_Equity}} and {{Total_Liabilities}} are the two components for {{Total_Assets}}: &lt;br&gt;Total Assets &#x3D; Total Shareholder&#39;s Equity + {{Total_Liabilities}}  &#x3D; {{Total_Current_Assets}} + {{TotalNonCurrentAssets}} &lt;br&gt;{{Total_Equity}} is used to calculate {{Book_Value_Per_Share}}: {{Book_Value_Per_Share}} &#x3D; ({{Total_Equity}} - {{Preferred_Stock}})/ {{BS_share}}. &lt;br&gt;The ratio of a company&#39;s debt over equity can be used to measure how leveraged this company is: {{deb2equity}} &#x3D; ({{Long-Term_Debt}} + {{Short-Term_Debt}})/{{Total_Equity}}.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
|**treasuryStock** | **BigDecimal** | &lt;p&gt;{{Treasury_Stock}} is the portion of shares that a company keeps in their own treasury. {{Treasury_Stock}} may have come from a repurchase or buyback from shareholders; or it may have never been issued to the public in the first place. These shares don&#39;t pay dividends, have no voting rights, and should not be included in shares outstanding calculations.&lt;/p&gt; |  [optional] |
