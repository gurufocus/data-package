Some of the most common parts of property, plant, and equipment are: Land, Buildings (and leasehold improvements), Transportation equipment, Manufacturing equipment, Office equipment, Office furniture. Companies with lots of property, plant, and equipment often have special categories. For example, railroad property includes: Track, Ties, Ballast, Bridges, Tunnels, Signals, Locomotives, Freight Cars. There is often a note in the financial statements - found in a company's 10-K - that will explain the different categories of property a company owns. <br>The market value of {{Net_PPE}} can differ tremendously from the book value of {{Net_PPE}}. For example, when Berkshire Hathaway liquidated its textile mills, it had to pay the buyers of the company's manufacturing equipment to haul the equipment  away. That {{Net_PPE}} was literally worth less than zero. On the other hand, some companies own thousands of acres of land. All {{Net_PPE}} other than land is depreciated. Land is never depreciated. However, land is not marked up to market value either. Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), land is shown on the balance sheet at cost. <br>The {{Net_PPE}} line shown on the balance sheet is usually net {{Net_PPE}}.

    preferred_stock: Optional[Union[StrictFloat, StrictInt]] = Field(default=None, description="<p>{{Preferred_Stock}} is a special equity security that has properties of both equity and debt. It is generally considered a hybrid instrument. {{Preferred_Stock}} is senior to {{CommonStock}}, but is subordinate to bonds in terms of claim or rights to their share of the assets of the company. {{Preferred_Stock}} has priority over {{CommonStock}} in the payment of dividends and any payments received when a company liquidates. <br>{{Preferred_Stock}} comes in many forms. It can be: Convertible or Non-Convertible, Cumulative or Non-Cumulative, Voting or Non-Voting, Callable or Non-Callable, Maturity Date or No Maturity Date. <br>A {{Preferred_Stock}} without a maturity date is called a perpetual preferred stock. These are relatively rare. A good example of perpetual {{Preferred_Stock}} is the many series of Public Storage (PSA) preferred shares that trade on the New York Stock Exchange. <br>Before investing in preferred stock, it is important to know which of the above groups the stock belongs to. Is it convertible or non-convertible? Are dividends cumulative or non-cumulative? It is also critical that an investor knows what bonds the company has in front of the {{Preferred_Stock}}. Bondholders get paid first. So the decision to buy a {{Preferred_Stock}} can be similar to the decision to buy a bond. But, remember, the {{Preferred_Stock}} of a company with bonds is junior to those bonds.  <br>Unless a {{Preferred_Stock}} is convertible, the upside in a preferred stock investment is more limited than in a {{CommonStock}} investment. If a company doubles its earnings, it is usually under no more obligation to double the dividends paid to preferred shareholders than it is to double the interest paid to its bankers and bondholders.So {{Preferred_Stock}} is very different from {{CommonStock}}.</p>")

Because the {{Net_Income}} was not distributed to shareholders, shareholders' equity is increased by the same amount. Of course, if a company loses, it is called retained losses, or accumulated losses. Historically profitable companies sometimes have negative {{Retained_Earnings}}. This is because they have cumulatively paid out more to shareholders than they reported in profits. If a company has negative {{Retained_Earnings}}, investors should check the 10-year financial results. They should not assume that negative {{Retained_Earnings}} prove a company has generally lost money in the past. Of course, many companies with negative {{Retained_Earnings}} have indeed lost money in the past.</p>")
    short_term_debt_and_capital_lease_obligation: Optional[Union[StrictFloat, StrictInt]] = Field(default=None, description="<p>{{Short-Term_Debt}} is the portion of a company's debt and capital lease obligation that need to be paid within the next 12 months. It equals {{ShortTermDebt_without_lease}} plus {{ShortTermCapitalLeaseObligation}}. This gives investors an idea of how much money the company needs to pay down for the principle of its debt.</p>")
    total_assets: Optional[Union[StrictFloat, StrictInt]] = Field(default=None, description="<p>{{Total_Assets}} are all the assets a company owns. From the capital sources of the assets, some of the assets are funded through shareholder's paid in capital and {{Retained_Earnings}} of the business. Others are funded through borrowed money. <br>Therefore, total assets can be calculated as: {{Total_Assets}} = {{Total_Current_Assets}} + {{TotalNonCurrentAssets}} = Total Shareholder's Equity + {{Total_Liabilities}} <br>Total Assets is connected with Return on Assets by {{ROA}} = {{Net_Income}} / {{Total_Assets}} <br> Total Assets is linked to {{Revenue}} through {{turnover}}: {{turnover}}  = {{Revenue}} / {{Total_Assets}} <br>Therefore, if a company grows its {{Total_Assets}} faster than its {{Revenue}}, the {{turnover}} will decline.
